.TH FIRESCOPE 1 
.SH NAME
firescope \- read linux kernel logs over firewire
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B firescope [-t] [-A] [-aTARGET] [-wLOGFILE] [System.map]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Firescope allows to read remote kernel memory over a firewire connection.
On x86-64 it is normally used to read the kernel log buffer.

On ppc it can be also used to operate xmon, but that is not described here.

.B -aNUM
attaches to the target NUMBER. See the menu shown by Ctrl-T 
for valid numbers.

.B -A
means attach to the first non local target.

-B -u
starts auto update modus directly without pressing any keys. 

The
.B -wLOGFILE
option writes a logfile of all log output from the target.

When the
.B -t
option is specified firescope doesn't enable terminal mode.
The normal keyboard commands don't work then. Implies -u.

System.map is the system table of the target kernel.
This cannot be /proc/kallsyms right now.

When 
.I -t
is not specified the program accepts Ctrl commands. See the help
menu for details.

.SH EXAMPLES
firescope -wLOG -tA System.map

Attach to first non local target and continuously log the kernel log
to stdout and LOG.

.SH NOTES
The target must have the ohci1394 driver loaded. This implies
that firescope cannot be used in early boot.

The raw1394 module must be loaded and its device node
be writable (this normally requires root) 

ppc is untested

The target must have the same bitness. For 32bit targets use
firescope32

Doesn't work with Xen.

Only tested on x86-64. ppc support might be bitrotted now.
